## The next generation of Dashed!


# How to install a Beta Build/Pre-Release

Super simple! Just download it [here](https://github.com/eclipsedteam/Dashed-V2/archive/master.zip)!

Head to your osu! folder, which can be found by heading to `Options` in game, and clicking on `Open osu! folder`

Then head to the `Skins` folder, and extract the `Dashed-V2-master` folder, thats inside the zip, into that folder.

Then just hit `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+S` on your keyboard in any area of osu!, and then the skin should pop up in your skins list!


# Questions you might ask:

## Why cant I get a .osk?
At the moment, Dashed V2 is still in development, so no osks are being released, so for now, you'll just need to work with a .zip.

## I found an issue! How do I report it?
Easy! Just head to the [Issues](https://github.com/eclipsedteam/Dashed-V2/issues/new) page, and tell us your problem! 

## When is the final release of Dashed V2 coming out?
Probably very soon! As we're just about ready to release it.
