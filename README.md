# Questions you might ask:

## Why can't I get a .osk?
At the moment, Dashed V2 is still in development, so no .osks are being released. So for now, you'll just need to work with a .zip.

Easy! Just head to the [Issues](https://github.com/eclipsedteam/Dashed-V2/issues/new) page, and tell us your problem!

Probably very soon! As we're just about ready to release it.
